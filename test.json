{ 'query': 'Please summarise in 5 slides everything about Cell Theory?', 'result': ' Slide 1: Introduction to Cell Theory\n- The smallest unit of life is a cell.\n- All living organisms are made up of one or more cells.\n- The cell theory states that cells are the basic units of life, and they carry out all the processes necessary for life. This principle was first proposed in the 19th century by scholars like Robert Hooke, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Theodor Schwann, Matthias Schleiden, and Rudolf Virchow.\n\nSlide 2: Discovery of Cells\n- A cell is the smallest unit that can carry out the processes of life. It is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells. If you look at living organisms under a microscope, you will see they are made up of cells. The word "cell" was first used by Robert Hooke, a British biologist and early microscopist.\n- Research in cell biology is closely linked to genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and developmental biology.\n\nSlide 3: Importance of Microscopes in Cell Discovery\n- The discovery of cells was made possible by the invention of the microscope.\n- Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek were two early scientists who used microscopes to observe cells for the first time.\n\nSlide 4: Components Common to All Cells\n- All cells have the same basic structure, carrying out similar life processes. These include transport of materials, obtaining and using energy, waste disposal, replication, and responding to their environment.\n\nSlide 5: Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells and Limitations on Cell Size\n- Prokaryotes are simple cells without a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria).\n- Eukaryotes are more complex cells with internal membranes, a cytoskeleton, and membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, etc. Examples of eukaryotic cells include human cells.\n- The smallest living cells are prokaryotes (bacteria), while the largest are certain types of eukaryotic cells like ostrich eggs and seaweed cells. The size of a cell is determined by its environment and function within the organism.' }
